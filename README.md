# Williams Wedding Hub

This is a single page application for Jaycee & Emily's wedding and family reunion. It provides schedule information, games, a guestbook, photo sharing and more. The project uses Tailwind CSS and Firebase on the front end.

## Development
Open `index.html` in a browser. A service worker is registered for offline support and a PWA manifest is provided. A dark mode toggle is included in the header.

Feel free to customize the manifest icons and Firebase configuration.
